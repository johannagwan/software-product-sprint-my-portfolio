      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>A tech noob who is still in the process of learning!
          A Year 2 NUS Computer Science student who is still very new to web development.
          A korean-shows-and-netflix enthusiast. An avid reader.
          A born and bred Indonesian who cannot eat spicy food.
          A Chinese who cannot speak Chinese.
          An EFNP. A new friend to you.
      </p>
      <p> Creating a personal portfolio has always made me reflect on what I have done or accomplished in my life.
          It reminds me on how far I have come and how far I still have to go. But here I go!
