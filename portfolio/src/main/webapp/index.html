        <p> Creating a personal portfolio has always made me reflect on what I have done or accomplished in my life.
            It reminds me on how far I have come and how far I still have to go. But here I go!

        <h3>Watercolour paintings</h3>
        <p>At the start of Circuit Breaker, I got hooked into trying out watercolour painting.
          I have always wanted to paint for my friends, but did not have time and resources to do that before.
          So I tried :) Here are my 2 attempts! However, I do not continue painting anymore because I don't have the thick watercolour
          paper, and drawing on a not-so-thick paper pains my heart.
