      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>Just a tech noob who is still in the process of learning!</p>
      <p>I'm a Year 2 NUS Computer Science student who is still very new to web development.
          In my free time, I love to watch korean variety shows, netflix, and read books. 
          This sounds like a typical introduction, isn't it? Okay, so let's move forward!
